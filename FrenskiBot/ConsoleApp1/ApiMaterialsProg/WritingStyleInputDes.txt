Please make an in-detail analysis of the following text, which describes its writing style, in a way that your output could be used as a guide in writing a future text in similar style. You should analyze everything about it, writing style, sentence length, very importantly its creativity and shape of the text (are bullet points included; how many dashes are under a bullet point; how long is the information under the dashes), its writing level, how descriptive or detailed the information is. Describe how, when stating information, tenses are used (what's the main tense, are there any extras and how are they included). List some quirks, common mistakes or repetitive habits found in the text. In general analyze any and everything that could help in building a detailed analysis, and remember to touch on and describe every characteristic here, while adding some more if needed.
