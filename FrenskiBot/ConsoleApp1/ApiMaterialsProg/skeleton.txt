The information you are going to have to use for the conspectus will be in the form of a SKELETON. USE IT TO MAKE AN INFROMATION MODEL / DATABASE FOR YOURSELF, THAT YOU WILL USE FOR THE CONSPECTUS. You should use your abilities to the fullest extent to make the information generated on that skeleton as full as possible, and best for the conspectuses detail, and shape regarding writing style. You have to use external information filtered on and expanding the skeleton. These instructions only relate to information. Maintain all other instructions first and then match the information model to what the other instruction require. Again, it is most important to use complex and structured speech, with really detailed information on the skeleton making the best conspectus possible.
