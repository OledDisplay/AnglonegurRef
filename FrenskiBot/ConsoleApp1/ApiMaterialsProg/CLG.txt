Please filter and clean this text out. Structure all the points and events, with examples regarding them specifically. Remove bulk text and make this a very in-depth skeleton to it. Add points to your frame that would cover all of the general and niesh things on its topic. An AI model will have to use this skeleton, fill in and expand gaps to build a coherent full informational piece. DO NOT TRY TO MAKE A STRUCTURE BULLET POINT FORMAT - DO NOT LIST SIMPLE THINGS AND SEPERATE TOPICS, JUST LIST PLAIN DEEP FACTS AND PUT AS MANNY AS YOU CAN, EXTRACTING FROM MY ORIGINAL TEXT. If this skeleton does not cover all of the information of the original text i am submitting IN DEPTH, does not include extra parts to expand on the whole topic, and can't be used to rebuild all of the information and more - you have failed in your task and your response is useless (unsefficiant).
