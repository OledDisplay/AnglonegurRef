4. **Text Shape and Structure**: Examine the physical layout of the text:
   - Are there headings, subheadings, or bullet points? If so, how are they used to structure information?
   - For bullet points: How many sub-points (e.g., dashes) are typically included under each bullet? How detailed are these sub-points (word count or descriptive depth)?
   - Are paragraphs short, medium, or long? How is the flow between sections or ideas maintained?

5. **Writing Level**: Describe the complexity of the vocabulary (e.g., simple, advanced, or domain-specific). Is the language accessible to all readers, or does it require expertise?
