Regarding the information I'm gonna give you, you should base most of what the conspectus contains on it, but it can include little parts of external information, if they are needed to improve the clarity of the bullet points. The original plan will also contain some extra information, which you should heavily reference, but not copy blindly. 

Back to information, the conspectus shouldn't be a 1 to 1 copy of the plan. It has to expand on it, the information it gives ex.

If you find a main point that lists a number of themes, events, people, social divisions / groups, religions / believes and any other of that type, separate them into different bullet points or logical parts (dedicate a bullet point to each one, that also contains information that fully describes it).

IF YOU FIND A PERSON OR EVENT MENTIONED, FORX EXAMPLE IF A QUESTION IS ASKED ABOUT THEIR IDEOLOGY OR BELIEFS, GO IN DEPTH WHEN DESCRIBING THEM, EXPLAINING EVERTHING THERE IS TO BE SAID.

Make sure to make the different dashes connected in a lyrical way (Make it seem like they are more over part of a big text, not separated chunks of information)

DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CLOSING STATEMENTS OR EXTRA PARAGRAPHS UNDER THE CONSPECTUS, YOU SHOULD PUT ALL THE SIZE-PROVIDED CHARACTERS IN THE CONSPECTUS

YOU HAVE TO WRITE IT IN BULGARIAN!!!!

FOLLOW THE WRITING STYLE and SIZE STRICTLY!!!
