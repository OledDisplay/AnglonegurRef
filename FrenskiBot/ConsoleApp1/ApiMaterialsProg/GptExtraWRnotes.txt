Got it! I'll rewrite your instructions to be more concise while keeping every detail and nuance intact. Here’s the optimized version:

### **Optimized API Input Instructions**  

Ensure **equal distribution** of content within the conspectus based on size limits. **Do not front-load information**—prioritize points discussing **major events or movements**. If a **big bullet point (numbered) lacks content**, give it extra priority and **underline it twice**.  

Strictly **follow the provided writing style**:  
- If the style requires **dashes**, structure information in **clear, distinct** dashes.  
- If a **paragraph** format is required, use full paragraphs.  

### **Content Expansion & Depth**  
- The conspectus should be **primarily based** on the given information but may **include minor external details** if necessary for depth.  
- **Expand every point** thoroughly—explain historical context, **societal and political impact**, and connections to broader movements.  
- For **figures**, describe their **beliefs, actions, and influence**.  
- For **events**, detail **their causes, effects, and wider implications**.  
- For **ideologies**, break down **foundations, key proponents, and practical implementation**.  

### **Clarity, Depth & Flow**  
- Do **not** merely list facts—**explain the significance** behind them.  
- If a person or event is **mentioned**, provide **full details** on their role, beliefs, and impact, even if their name appears in a question.  
- When using **dashes**, ensure they flow **lyrically**, forming a **cohesive narrative** rather than isolated points.  

### **Writing Style & Language**  
- Maintain **a formal, scholarly tone**, using **precise academic terminology** for historical figures, concepts, and events.  
- **Writing style** takes priority over tone—**match sentence complexity** as required.  
- Use **words ending in "йки"** (e.g., „показвайки, изразявайки“) to replace **heavy, monotone phrases**.  
- Do **not repeat** content unnecessarily—ensure **each dash adds new detail**.  
- The text should be **lightweight, deeply informative, and lyrical**, **preserving clarity while ensuring smooth, natural flow**.  

### **Structural & Formatting Rules**  
- **Ignore all questions in the plan** - ignore all extra tasks / questions, write nothing on them
- **Preserve the plan exactly**—do **not remove or alter** points.  
- **Do not** include **closing statements** or summary paragraphs—use all available characters **within the conspectus itself**.  
- If the plan mentions **information directly**, do **not copy it verbatim**—**expand on it** instead.  
- **Write in Bulgarian.**
