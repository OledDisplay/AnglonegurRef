Regarding the information I'm gonna give you, you should base most of what the conspectus contains on it, but it can include little parts of external information, if they are needed to improve the clarity of the bullet points. The original plan will also contain some extra information. YOU HAVE TO really expand and focus on these bits of info.

Expand on each point with in-depth detail. Donâ€™t just mention concepts or events; explain their historical context, impact, and relevance. For historical figures, elaborate on their beliefs, actions, and philosophies, and for events, describe their implications on society and the political landscape. If using dashes under bullet points, split up separate events / ideologies or any of that kind into separate bullet points.

Ensure the writing adopts a formal and scholarly tone. Use precise academic terminology, particularly when discussing historical figures, concepts, and events.

IF YOU FIND A PERSON OR EVENT MENTIONED, FORX EXAMPLE IF A QUESTION IS ASKED ABOUT THEIR IDEOLOGY OR BELIEFS, GO IN DEPTH WHEN DESCRIBING THEM, EXPLAINING EVERTHING THERE IS TO BE SAID.

If using dashes under the bullet points make sure they are connected in a lyrical way (Make it seem like they are more over part of a big text, not separated chunks of information).


DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CLOSING STATEMENTS OR EXTRA PARAGRAPHS UNDER THE CONSPECTUS, YOU SHOULD PUT ALL THE SIZE-PROVIDED CHARACTERS IN THE CONSPECTUS

YOU HAVE TO WRITE IT IN BULGARIAN!!!!

FOLLOW THE WRITING STYLE and SIZE STRICTLY!!!
