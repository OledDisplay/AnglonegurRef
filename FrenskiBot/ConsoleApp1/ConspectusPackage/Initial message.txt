Can you write me a conspectus based on the plan and information I give you. It has to follow the original plan blindly, do not change the points it contains. Under each point put 2 - 3 bullet points with information, regarding it. They have to be clear, but fulling in terms of the information they contain. 

Regarding the information I'm gonna give you, you should base most of what the conspectus contains on it, but it can include little parts of external information, if they are needed to improve the clarity of the bullet points. The original plan will also contain some extra information, which you should heavily reference, but not copy blindly. 

Back to information, the conspectus shouldn't be a 1 to 1 copy of the plan. It has to expand on it, the information it gives ex.

If you find a main point that lists a number of themes, events, people, social divisions / groups, religions / believes and any other of that type, separate them into different bullet points (dedicate a bullet point to each one, that also contains information that fully describes it).

IT SHOULD BE AROUND 400 WORDS IN SIZE!!!

YOU HAVE TO WRITE IT IN BULGARIAN!!!! USE UNCOMPLEX SPEECH, ON A LEVEL OF A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT.

I WILL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLE TEXTS. WRITE THE CONSPECTUS IN THEIR FASHION, BUT REMEMBER TO FOLLOW THE ORIGINAL INTRUCTIONS FIRST, AND THEN LOOK AT THE EXAMPLES FOR STYLE.


I'm going to start imputing material for the text, DO NOT WRITE UNTIL I TELL YOU!!!!
