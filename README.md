A program that writes conspectuses based on the Prosveta history book. 
Current functionality includes outputting text from a requested lesson.

The current program is not finished so referense the ConspectusPackage cd for isntructions and materials for usage.
In orther to combat the device limit on the Prosveta site, the program is build to extract the whole textbook in one sitting (too be contained localy), so find time to do that upon initial usage.
Contact the FrenskiBot owner when you wish to download the textbook.

This is not the final build of the project, so the code doesn't contain notes, regarding ease of usage. On final descriptive notes will allow easy addaptation to other textbooks will be possible.
